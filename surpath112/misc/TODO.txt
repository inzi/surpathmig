If payment for cohort is setup, and a student is moved into that cohort, they should be warned that the student will be required to pay.

We need a permission that allows an admin to override the required payment.

Therefore, when they're moved into the cohort, if the user has permission, warn that a payment will be due by the student, and if they wish override they must provide a note.

add it into the table with zero

--
we also need a page to view a cohort's payment status - host users get a table to override.. add note / or on actions....

-- 

Permission at the school level to add payment requirements.


We'll need a tool so the school to see payment with ranges to see the table --- Payment Audit Page

The isenabled should allow to turn surpath services on and off for a specific shool, department, or cohort, or user - just like pricing
then the compliance application should lean on the isenabled flag to determine if the service is applicable for that user.
