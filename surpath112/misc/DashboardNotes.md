Widget get set to top element


For viewing a Program (dept) compliance, you see chorts

For viewing Cohorts, you see users



So, a program compliance widget actually gets the cohorts

a Cohort compliance widget actually gets the cohortUsers

When we introduce groups, we add that to the selection filter and store it

-------- Current Program widget:
get a view model that has the dept and the associated cohorts with compliance totals.


The program compliance widget displays all programs (not filterable) with compliance summaries - clicking on one take the user to the Program.

The Cohort compliance shows all cohorts and their compliance summaries (filterable by program and / or group (aka campus) [future]) - clicking takes user directly to cohort

a Cohort User compliance widget shows all cohortusers and their compliance summaries - clicking on one take user direcly to the donor
