# Modified
## Filename
ServiceCollectionRegistrar.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Migrator\DependencyInjection\ServiceCollectionRegistrar.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file registers services using dependency injection techniques with libraries such as AbpDependency and Castle.Windsor.MsDependencyInjection. The class IdentityRegistrar is used to register services into a collection, which likely helps in managing service dependencies within an ASP.NET application.
## Changes
The only change between the modified and unmodified versions is the namespace declaration; it was changed from 'Migrationodi' to 'Migratorodi'.
## Purpose
This file is part of the dependency injection configuration, where services are being registered into a collection for proper management within an ASP.NET Zero solution.
