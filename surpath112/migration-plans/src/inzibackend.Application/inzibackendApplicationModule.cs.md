# Modified
## Filename
inzibackendApplicationModule.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application\inzibackendApplicationModule.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file includes a Startup configuration using Abp.Configuration startup, which likely adds default services or configurations when the module initializes. The unmodified file lacks this additional configuration.
## Changes
Added the using statement for Abp.Configuration.Startup in the modified content.
## Purpose
Both files are application layer modules that initialize and register themselves with IocManager, with the modified version additionally configuring startup settings.
