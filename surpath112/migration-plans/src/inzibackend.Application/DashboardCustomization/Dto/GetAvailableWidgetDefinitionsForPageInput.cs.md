# Modified
## Filename
GetAvailableWidgetDefinitionsForPageInput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application\DashboardCustomization\Dto\GetAvailableWidgetDefinitionsForPageInput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file contains a class with three public properties (DashboardName, Application, PageId) that appear to be part of an ASP.NET Zero configuration. The only difference between the modified and unmodified versions is formatting: extra spaces before semicolons in the modified version.
## Changes
The modified content adds whitespace characters before each semicolon in the property declarations.
## Purpose
This class likely serves as a configuration helper for dashboard widget definitions within an ASP.NET Zero application.
