# Modified
## Filename
IChatMessageListExcelExporter.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application\Chat\Exporting\IChatMessageListExcelExporter.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines an interface IChatMessageListExcelExporter with a method ExportToFile that takes a UserIdentifier and a list of ChatMessageExportDto objects, returning a FileDto. This suggests it's part of an Excel export functionality for chat messages.
## Changes
No changes detected between the modified and unmodified versions; both files contain identical code except for potential formatting issues in namespace usage.
## Purpose
The interface is likely used within an ASP.NET Zero application to handle exporting chat message data into Excel format, possibly as part of a data export or reporting module.
