## Summary
The modified file includes additional comments explaining why `Setting ComVisible(false)` was set and how it affects COM component visibility.

Added two lines: // Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible to COM components. If you need to access a type in this assembly from COM, setting the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
