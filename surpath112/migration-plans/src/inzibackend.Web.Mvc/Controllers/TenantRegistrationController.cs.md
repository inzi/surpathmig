## Changes
Additional using statements and namespaces were added in the modified file, such as 'using inzibackend.Editions;' and 'using inzibackend.MultiTenancy.Payments DTO;'. The namespace declaration was also updated to include 'using inzibackend.Authorization;' instead of 'using Abp.Authorization;'.
