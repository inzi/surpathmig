# Modified
## Filename
VerifySecurityCodeViewModel.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Models\Account\VerifySecurityCodeViewModel.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file contains a VerifySecurityCodeViewModel class with several properties including Provider, Code, ReturnUrl, RememberBrowser, RememberMe, and IsRememberBrowserEnabled. The unmodified version is identical except that the IsRememberBrowserEnabled property does not have an [AbpDisplayName] attribute in the modified version.
## Changes
The modified file adds the [AbpDisplayName] attribute to the IsRememberBrowserEnabled property.
## Purpose
The class appears to be part of an ASP.NET Zero project, likely used for dependency injection and localization within a web application.
