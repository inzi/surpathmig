# Modified
## Filename
LoginFormViewModel.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Models\Account\LoginFormViewModel.cs

## Summary
The modified file contains a LoginFormViewModel class with four public properties: SuccessMessage (string), UserNameOrEmailAddress (string), IsSelfRegistrationEnabled (bool), and IsTenantSelfRegistrationEnabled (bool).
## Changes
No changes were made to the original file. The modified content is identical to the unmodified version.
## Purpose
The class appears to be part of a dependency injection configuration within an ASP.NET Zero application, defining model properties that would be injected into service constructors.
