# Modified
## Filename
WidgetsController.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Areas\App\Controllers\WidgetsController.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file adds two using statements at the top of the namespace declaration. These are part of the inzibackend namespace setup and are required for the project's configuration.
## Changes
Added two using statements:
1. using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
2. using inzibackendWebControllers;
These are necessary for the proper setup of the inzibackend namespace in the ASP.NET Zero solution.
## Purpose
The file is part of an ASP.NET Zero project and contains controllers that handle CRUD operations for different sections (Host and Tenant) within the application.
