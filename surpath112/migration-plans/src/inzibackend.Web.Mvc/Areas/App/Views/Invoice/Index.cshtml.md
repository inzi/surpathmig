## Summary
Both files contain HTML markup for a .NET Core model view class InvoiceViewModel with similar content except the modified version has an extra closing brace.
## Changes
The modified file adds an extra closing brace `</div>` which is not present in the unmodified version, resulting in syntax errors.
## Purpose
These files are part of an ASP.NET Zero project and define a model view for displaying invoice data with fields such as date, tenant legal name, host legal name, addresses, edition, amount, and total.
