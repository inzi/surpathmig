## Summary
The modified and unmodified content are parts of an ASP.NET Zero project that handle a modal view for editing tenant features. The files contain code snippets from a TenantFeaturesEditViewModel class that defines methods for creating partial HTML async requests to display the modal.
## Changes
The only change is in one button within the modal footer where the text was updated from 'Reset Special Features' to 'Reset Features' and an emoji was added.
## Purpose
These files are part of a dependency injection configuration that defines how tenant features can be edited, including creating partial HTML requests for displaying modals.
