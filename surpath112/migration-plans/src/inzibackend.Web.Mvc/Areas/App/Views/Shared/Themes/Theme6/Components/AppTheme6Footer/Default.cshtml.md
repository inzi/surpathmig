## Summary
The modified FooterViewModel includes a footer div with product name and version text. The key difference from the unmodified version is that 'fw-bold' in the modified code should be corrected to 'font-weight: bold;' for proper styling.
## Changes
In the modified version, the attribute 'fw-bold' was used instead of the correct 'font-weight: bold;'. This change affects how the product name and version are displayed by altering the font weight.
## Purpose
The FooterViewModel class is part of an ASP.NET Zero application's layout system, responsible for formatting and positioning the footer content with specific typography styling.
