# Modified
## Filename
AppQuickThemeSelectViewComponent.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Areas\App\Views\Shared\Components\AppQuickThemeSelect\AppQuickThemeSelectViewComponent.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file contains additional using statements and correct namespace formatting compared to the unmodified version.
## Changes
1. Two using statements are missing: inzibackend.Web_areas.App.Models.Layout and inzibackend.Web.Views.
2. The namespace declaration has an extra underscore before 'Web' (Web_areas instead of Web).
The functionality remains the same as both versions contain a view component that accepts CSS and icon classes.
## Purpose
The file is part of an ASP.NET Web Application, providing UI components for theme selection.
