## Summary
The modified file contains a single class AppTheme8BrandViewComponent that inherits from inzibackendViewComponent. The class has a private readonly field _sessionCache of type IPerRequestSessionCache and an constructor that initializes this field. The class also has an async method InvokeAsync which retrieves the current login information from the session cache using CurrentGetLoginInformationsAsync and passes it to a HeaderViewModel.
## Changes
The modified file includes additional whitespace for better code formatting without altering the functionality or structure of the original unmodified content.
## Purpose
This component is part of an ASP.NET application's theme system, specifically handling session-based user authentication information injection into the header view.
