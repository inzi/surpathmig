## Language

## Summary
Both files contain similar code for retrieving and displaying menu items but differ in their implementation details. The modified file includes a wrapper div with hover effects and additional styling, while the unmodified file uses a simpler structure without these enhancements.
## Changes
The modified file adds a wrapper div with hover-scroll overlay-y class, an additional menu div with menu-column and menu-state-title-primary classes, and an @if statement for search active functionality. The unmodified file lacks these features.
## Purpose
The modified file aims to enhance the sidebar's visual appearance by adding hover effects and styling while maintaining conditional rendering based on the search setting.
