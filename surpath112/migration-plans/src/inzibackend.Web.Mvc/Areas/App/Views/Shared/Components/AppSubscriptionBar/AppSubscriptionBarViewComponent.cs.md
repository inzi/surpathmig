## Relative Path

## Summary
The modified file contains an AppSubscriptionBarViewComponent that accepts a session cache and displays subscription information with specific styling. The unmodified version has similar functionality but uses different CSS classes.
## Changes
The main change is in the CSS class string, which was updated from 'btn btn-icon btn-custom...' to 'btn btn-icon btn-active-light-primary...', indicating a reduction in the number of CSS properties applied to the button element.
## Purpose
This component serves as a styled view for displaying subscription details such as login notifications and expiration alerts within an ASP.NET Zero application.
