## Summary
The modified file contains an EntityChangeDetailModalViewModel that displays audit log changes. It includes formatting for values based on their data types (DateTime handled with specific parsing). The unmodified version has similar functionality but without the extra formatting inconsistencies.
## Changes
The modified content introduces minor formatting inconsistencies, such as additional spaces in method calls and font-weight attributes using 'fw-bold' instead of 'font-weight-bold'.
## Purpose
This file is a modal view used to display changes made to an entity's audit logs, showing original and new values formatted appropriately.
