# Modified
## Filename
_ChangePictureModal.cshtml
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Areas\App\Views\Profile\_ChangePictureModal.cshtml
## Language
Unknown
## Summary
Both the modified and unmodified files contain similar code for a modal form that allows users to change their profile picture. The primary differences are minor formatting inconsistencies in comments.
## Changes
The only difference is an additional space before the question mark in the HTML comment line: `var canUseGravatarProfilePicture = await SettingManager.GetSettingValueAsync<bool>("App.UserManagement.AllowUsingGravatarProfilePicture");` in the modified version has a space before the question mark compared to the unmodified version.
## Purpose
These files are part of an Inzibackend configuration for a modal form that allows users to upload and configure their profile picture, including checkboxes and file input fields.
