# Modified
## Filename
ModalHeaderViewModel.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Areas\App\Models\Common\Modals\ModalHeaderViewModel.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
Both the modified and unmodified files contain a C# class `ModalHeaderViewModel` with a public `Title` property and a constructor that sets the title.
## Changes
The modified file contains an extra curly brace after the opening brace of the `ModalHeaderViewModel` class, which is not present in the unmodified version. This results in invalid syntax.
## Purpose
The `ModalHeaderViewModel` class appears to be part of a model layer handling modal header functionality, likely used for displaying title information within ASP.NET Zero applications.
