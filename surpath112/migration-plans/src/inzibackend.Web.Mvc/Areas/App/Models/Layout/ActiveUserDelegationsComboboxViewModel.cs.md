# Modified
## Filename
ActiveUserDelegationsComboboxViewModel.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\Areas\App\Models\Layout\ActiveUserDelegationsComboboxViewModel.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a ViewModel class with three properties: UserDelegationConfiguration (IUserDelegationConfiguration), UserDelegations (List<UserDelegationDto>), and CssClass (string).
## Changes
The only change between the modified and unmodified versions is in the formatting of the using statements. In the modified version, each using statement is on its own line without semicolons or commas, whereas in the unmodified version, they are grouped together with a comma.
## Purpose
This file appears to be part of an ASP.NET Zero solution and defines a ViewModel class for handling user delegation configurations and CSS styling.
