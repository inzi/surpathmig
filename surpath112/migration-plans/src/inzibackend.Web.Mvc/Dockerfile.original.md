## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files define an ASP.NET Zero setup with version 6.0, specifying a base image and an entry point to run the application.
## Changes
The unmodified file appears to have a typo in its FROM clause, possibly missing or incorrectly placing 'AS' before 'baseWORKDIR'.
## Purpose
These files configure the base image and entry point for running the ASP.NET Zero application.
