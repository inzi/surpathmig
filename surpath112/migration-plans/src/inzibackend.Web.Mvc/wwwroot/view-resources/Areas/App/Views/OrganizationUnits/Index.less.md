# Modified
## Filename
Index.less
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\wwwroot\view-resources\Areas\App\Views\OrganizationUnits\Index.less
## Language
Unknown
## Summary
The modified file adds a department count property (.ou-text-department-count) styled in bold to the .ou-text class. The unmodified version lacks this addition.
## Changes
.ou-text-department-count { font-weight: bold; } is added in the modified content, while the unmodified version does not include it.
## Purpose
Both files appear to be part of an OU text style configuration within an ASP.NET Zero solution, ensuring consistent styling across different sections such as members, roles, and departments.
