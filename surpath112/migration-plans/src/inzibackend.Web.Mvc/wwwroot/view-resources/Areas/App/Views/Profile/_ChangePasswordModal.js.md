## Summary
Both files define a ChangePasswordModal function that configures and validates a password change process using app services.
## Changes
The modified content includes an additional line in the init method: _modalManager.getModal();, which is unnecessary as it doesn't affect functionality.
## Purpose
Configuration setup for password change functionality within the ASP.NET Zero application.
