## Summary
This file contains a JavaScript snippet that manages roles in an application using Entity Framework Core (EFCore). It includes functionality to create, edit, and delete roles, as well as filter roles based on specific permissions. The file uses ABP services for role operations and provides a modal interface for user interaction.
## Changes
The modified version wraps the event listener inside another function, which is not present in the unmodified version. This change improves code encapsulation and prevents potential issues with variable scope or external influences.
## Purpose
This file serves as an implementation of role management functionality within an ASP.NET Zero application, integrating with ABP services for role operations and providing a user-friendly interface through modals.
