# Modified
## Filename
_AddRoleModal.js
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\wwwroot\view-resources\Areas\App\Views\OrganizationUnits\_AddRoleModal.js
## Language
JavaScript
## Summary
The modified code introduces additional variables and encapsulates certain operations, while fixing a potential redundancy by removing an unnecessary assignment of _options to null.
## Changes
Added variable assignments for $saveButton and _options = null; in the modified content. Encapsulated save button state updates using these variables instead of directly accessing the element.
## Purpose
The file improves code encapsulation and fixes a potential redundancy by removing an unnecessary assignment.
