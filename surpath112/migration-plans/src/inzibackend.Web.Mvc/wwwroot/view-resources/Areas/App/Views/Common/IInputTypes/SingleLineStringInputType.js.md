## Summary
The modified file defines an input type for single-line strings with validation capabilities, including numeric ranges and regular expressions.
## Changes
1. Corrected a typo in the modified version: `feature._inputType.validator` was changed to `_inputTypeInfo.validator`. This fixes a reference error where the validator properties were not properly accessed.
## Purpose
