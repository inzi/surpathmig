## Filename
RegionalStats.js
## Relative Path

## Language
JavaScript
## Summary
The modified file introduces additional functionality for displaying regional statistics with charts and tables. It includes a new method (refreshInitregionalStats) that fetches regional stats data and updates the UI elements such as tables and embedded charts.
## Changes
Added 'refreshInitregionalStats' method to process regional stats data, including creating table rows with embedded charts for sales, average price, and total price. The unmodified version likely lacked this enhanced data display functionality.
## Purpose
The modified file enhances the UI by displaying detailed regional statistics in a structured format with charts, which is part of dependency injection or configuration handling in an ASP.NET Zero solution.
