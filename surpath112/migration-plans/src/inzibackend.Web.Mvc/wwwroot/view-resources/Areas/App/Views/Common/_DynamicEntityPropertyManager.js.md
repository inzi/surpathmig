# Modified
## Filename
_DynamicEntityPropertyManager.js
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\wwwroot\view-resources\Areas\App\Views\Common\_DynamicEntityPropertyManager.js
## Language
JavaScript
## Summary
The modified DynamicEntityPropertyManager function includes an additional getAllEntityNames() function that retrieves all entities with dynamic properties before returning the object. The unmodified version lacks this function.
## Changes
Added getAllEntityNames() function and called it before returning the object in the modified content.
## Purpose
The file is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution, likely handling dynamic entity property management through dependency injection and permissions.
