## Summary
The modified file includes additional CSS styles for form controls and table cells. The .auto-complete-off.form-control[readonly] class adds a background color to readonly form fields that are not auto-complete enabled. The img.img-circle class in #UsersTable sets a height of 24px and margin-right of 5px, which was already present in the unmodified content. Additionally, the modified file includes min-height: 37px; for list items in .user-edit-modal ul.nav-tabs li a.
## Changes
.auto-complete-off.form-control[readonly] { background-color: #fff !important; } and min-height: 37px; were added to specific elements.
## Purpose
Styling enhancements for form controls, auto-complete features, and table cells in an ASP.NET Zero application.
