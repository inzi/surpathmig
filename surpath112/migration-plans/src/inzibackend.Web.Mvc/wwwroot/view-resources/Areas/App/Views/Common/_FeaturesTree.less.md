## Summary
The modified code applies CSS styles to .feature-tree-textbox elements with max-width: 100px, margin: 1px, and margin-left: 5px. The invalid state is styled with a red background. Additionally, it sets the background-image for .jstree-checkbox using an image from /Common/Images/jstree_32px_line.png.
## Changes
No changes were made to the code content; only comment formatting was altered from /* */ to //.
## Purpose
The CSS styles are part of an ASP.NET application's style configuration, styling feature tree textboxes and checkboxes.
