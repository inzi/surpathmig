# Modified
## Filename
_CreateModal.js
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Mvc\wwwroot\view-resources\Areas\App\Views\OrganizationUnits\_CreateModal.js
## Language
JavaScript
## Summary
The modified file defines a modal function that creates an organization unit upon saving. It includes initialization and save methods which validate the form and create the organization unit using dependency injection.
## Changes
The formatting of line breaks and indentation was altered between the modified and unmodified versions, but no actual code changes were made to the functionality.
## Purpose
This file is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution where it likely configures a modal for creating organization units by leveraging dependency injection services.
