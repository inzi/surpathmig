## Summary
The provided JavaScript code defines a utility module `app.widgetBase` that provides a function to create widgets with delayed initialization. It includes a method `runDelayed` which schedules the execution of a callback after a specified delay, and a factory-like method `create` that returns an instance of `app.widgetBase`. This module likely supports dependency injection patterns in an ASP.NET Zero application by enabling flexible widget creation and delayed initialization.
