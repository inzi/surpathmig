## Language

## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files are part of an ASP.NET Zero solution that integrates Stripe for checkout functionality. They set up Stripe with publishable keys and session IDs, then bind a click event to redirect to checkout.
## Changes
The modified version has an extra closing parenthesis in the prepareStripeButton function definition, likely causing syntax errors.
## Purpose
These functions are part of the application setup for Stripe integration, preparing necessary configurations and handling checkout events.
