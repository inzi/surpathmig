## Summary
The JavaScript file defines a class KTCustomerViewPaymentMethod that handles payment method actions. It includes two private functions: initPaymentMethod and handlePrimaryButton. The former iterates over table rows matching specific data attributes, selects delete buttons, and shows confirmation dialogs for deletion. The latter targets a button with a specific data attribute, showing confirmation dialogs when clicked to set the card as primary.
