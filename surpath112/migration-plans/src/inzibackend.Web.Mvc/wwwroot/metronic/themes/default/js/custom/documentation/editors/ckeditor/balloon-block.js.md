## Summary
The file defines a utility class `KTFormsCKEditorBalloonBlock` which provides functionality for creating balloon editors using CKEditor integration. The class includes an initialization method `init` that is called when the DOM is ready, facilitated by `KTUtil.onDOMContentLoaded`. This suggests it's used in an ASP.NET Zero context to inject or configure editor components.
