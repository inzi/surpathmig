## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files contain ASP.NET Localization directives and scripts for a payment flow page. The modified version includes inline style formatting in the loading section and uses a local CSS file instead of a ViewBag one.
## Changes
The modified file adds an inline style to the loading section's div element, changing its class from 'my-5' to 'm-0', and replaces the styles link with a local CSS file. The unmodified version uses a ViewBag styles link.
## Purpose
These files contribute to user interface localization and styling in an ASP.NET Zero application.
