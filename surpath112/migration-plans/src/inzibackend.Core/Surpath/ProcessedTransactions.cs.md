## Summary
The provided C# code defines an auditable entity class 'ProcessedTransactions' that extends FullAuditedEntity and implements IMayHaveTenant interface. It includes two public properties: TenantId (nullable) and TransactionId, both likely used for tracking transactions in a database table named 'ProcessedTransactions'. The class is part of an Entity Framework Core setup, suggesting it's used for auditing purposes within an ASP.NET Zero solution.
