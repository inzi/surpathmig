## Summary
The file defines an Entity class TenantDocument implementing FullAuditedEntity and IMayHaveTenant interfaces, annotated with Table('TenantDocuments'). The class contains properties such as TenantId, Name, AuthorizedOnly, Description, TenantDocumentCategoryId (with a foreign key), and RecordId (with another foreign key). This suggests it is part of a database schema for tracking tenant-related document information.
