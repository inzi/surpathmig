# Modified
## Filename
IChatCommunicator.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Chat\IChatCommunicator.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines an interface (IChatCommunicator) with methods for sending messages and state changes across clients in a chat application. The unmodified version is identical except for a minor code style difference in the using statement.
## Changes
The only change between the versions is the formatting of the 'using' statement: the modified file has an extra space before 'using System.Collections.Generic;'.
## Purpose
The interface defines methods for inter-client communication, likely used in a real-time messaging application built with ASP.NET Zero.
