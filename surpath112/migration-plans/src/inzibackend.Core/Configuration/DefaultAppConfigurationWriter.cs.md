## Filename
DefaultAppConfigurationWriter.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Configuration\DefaultAppConfigurationWriter.cs
## Language

## Summary
The modified file contains an ASP.NET Zero configuration writer class that implements singleton dependency injection interface and IAppConfigurationWriter interface. It includes a null logger instance and a Write method that logs a message indicating it's not implemented.
## Changes
No changes detected between the modified and unmodified versions of the file; they are identical in structure and functionality.
## Purpose
The class serves as an abstract configuration writer implementation that uses singleton dependency injection for logging configurations, though its actual write operation is currently not implemented.
