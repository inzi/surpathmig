## Filename

## Relative Path

## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file contains an interface definition for ISupportsRecurringPayments which defines event handlers for recurring payments management across different tenancy versions.
## Changes
No changes in functionality or structure; the only difference is the formatting of the 'using' statement without a semicolon.
## Purpose
The interface likely plays a role in managing recurring payment events within an ASP.NET Zero application, possibly enabling or disabling recurring payments and handling changes to the tenant edition.
