## Summary
This file contains the corrected version of the `TenantDemoDataBuilder` class with a typo fixed. The method name `IsInDemoMode` now correctly includes a space after 'IsInDemoMode'.
## Changes
The line `public bool IsInDemoMode` was modified to add a space after 'IsInDemoMode'.
## Purpose
This class is used to build demo data for new tenants by creating organizational units, users, and related configurations. It operates only in Demo mode when the configuration setting 'App.DemoMode' is enabled.
