# Modified
## Filename
Role.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Authorization\Roles\Role.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a Role class that inherits from AbpRole<User>. The class includes constructor overloads accepting different combinations of tenantId, name, and displayName. The namespace declaration matches the using statements in the unmodified version.
## Changes
The namespace declaration does not match the using directives; the namespace appears to be incorrect.
## Purpose
The Role class is part of an ASP.NET Zero project, likely handling authorization roles by extending AbpRole<User> with customizable properties.
