## Filename
RoleManager.cs
## Relative Path

## Summary
The modified RoleManager class includes additional configuration parameters and localization handling. It adds ILocalizationManager to the constructor and introduces a private method L() that likely handles string localization.
## Changes
Added ILocalizationManager parameter to constructor, removed L() method which was part of the unmodified version.
## Purpose
The RoleManager now properly integrates localization management for consistent string handling across the application.
