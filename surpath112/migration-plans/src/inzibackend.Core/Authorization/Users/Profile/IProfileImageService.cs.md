## Filename
IProfileImageService.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Authorization\Users\Profile\IProfileImageService.cs

## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files define an interface IProfileImageService that implements IDomainService. The interface contains a method GetProfilePictureContentForUser which accepts a UserIdentifier and returns a Task<string>.
## Changes
The only change is the addition of an extra space in the using directive.
## Purpose
This file likely serves as a dependency injection container interface within an ASP.NET Zero application.
