# Modified
## Filename
GravatarProfileImageService.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Authorization\Users\Profile\GravatarProfileImageService.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The GravatarProfileImageService class in both versions implements the same interface with a constructor that initializes two readonly fields, _userManager and _abpSession. The service methods GetProfilePictureContentForUser and GetMd5Hash are identical across both versions.
## Changes
No significant differences were found between the modified and unmodified versions of the code. Both versions contain identical implementation for the GravatarProfileImageService class.
## Purpose
The class is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution, likely used for dependency injection in the backend to retrieve profile images based on user email addresses.
