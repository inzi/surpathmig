# Modified
## Filename
PermissionChecker.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Authorization\PermissionChecker.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files contain a PermissionChecker class that extends PermissionChecker with Role and User parameters. The namespace declaration is the only difference between them.
## Changes
The using statement for inzibackend.Authorization was changed from Abp.Authorization to inzibackend.Authorization.
## Purpose
The file is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution, likely handling user authorization by checking permissions.
