# Modified
## Filename
TempFileInfo.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Storage\TempFileInfo.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
Both modified and unmodified files define a TempFileInfo class with three properties (FileName, FileType, File) and three constructors.
## Changes
The modified content contains an extra closing brace after the last constructor in the class definition, causing incorrect syntax and premature closure of the class.
## Purpose
The class likely serves as a simple storage mechanism or helper for file operations within an ASP.NET Zero application.
