# Modified
## Filename
FileUploadCacheOutput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Core\Storage\FileUploadCacheOutput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a class FileUploadCacheOutput that extends ErrorInfo. It includes a FileToken property and two constructors: one that accepts a string to set FileToken, and another that copies properties from an ErrorInfo instance.
## Changes
The only change is the formatting of the constructor in the modified version, which adds line breaks before each assignment statement for readability.
## Purpose
The class provides a custom error output format with additional information such as file token and validation errors.
