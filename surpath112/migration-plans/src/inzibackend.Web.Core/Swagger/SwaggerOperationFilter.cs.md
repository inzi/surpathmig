## Relative Path

## Summary
The modified file implements a SwaggerOperationFilter class that applies filters to operation parameters. It specifically handles enum types by generating and assigning schemas for each parameter.
## Changes
The only change is in the using statement where there's no space between 'using' and the first identifier, which is a minor formatting difference.
## Purpose
This file is part of an ASP.NET Zero project, likely used for dependency injection or configuration management.
