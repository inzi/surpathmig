# Modified
## Filename
Theme4UiCustomizer.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Web.Core\UiCustomization\Metronic\Theme4UiCustomizer.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified code includes several changes such as using different method names for setting values (e.g., `AppSettings.UiManagement_darkMode` instead of `AppSettings darkmode`) and adding a parameter to the `GetSettingValueAsync` calls. The unmodified version uses similar logic but with slight syntax differences.
## Changes
The modified code introduces changes in how certain settings are fetched, including using different method names for accessing configuration values (e.g., `AppSettings.UiManagement_darkMode` instead of `AppSettings darkmode`) and adding a parameter to the `GetSettingValueAsync` calls. Additionally, some methods now include a `tenantId` parameter when fetching values.
## Purpose
The modified code appears to be adjusting how configuration settings are accessed, possibly for tenant-specific or application-wide contexts, introducing slight variations in method calls and parameters.
