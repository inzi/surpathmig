## Summary
The modified file is identical to the unmodified version. The class implements an UploadFiles endpoint that accepts multiple files, validates their size, converts them into binary objects, and saves them using the IBinaryObjectManager.
## Changes
No changes were made to the original file. The code remains unchanged and functional.
## Purpose
The controller handles file uploads by converting files into binary objects and saving them through dependency injection.
