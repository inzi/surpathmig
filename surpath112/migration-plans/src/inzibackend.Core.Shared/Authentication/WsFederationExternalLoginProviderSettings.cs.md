## Summary
The modified file is identical to the unmodified version. It defines a class with public properties for client ID, tenant, metadata address, Wtrealm, authority, and an IsValid method that checks if client ID is not null or empty.
## Changes
No changes were made to this file; it remains identical in both versions.
## Purpose
The class appears to be part of a general codebase without specific ASP.NET Zero framework-related functionality.
