# Modified
## Filename
GetAuditLogsInput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Auditing\Dto\GetAuditLogsInput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a class GetAuditLogsInput that inherits from PagedAndSortedInputDto and implements IShouldNormalize. It contains properties such as StartDate, EndDate, UserName, ServiceName, MethodName, BrowserInfo, HasException, MinExecutionDuration, MaxExecutionDuration. The class includes a Normalize method that modifies sorting criteria based on specific patterns.
## Changes
No changes were made to the original file; it appears identical except for minor formatting inconsistencies.
## Purpose
The file is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution and likely serves as a data transfer object (DTO) for retrieving audit logs, facilitating sorting and normalization operations.
