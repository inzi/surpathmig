# Modified
## Filename
IHostSettingsAppService.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Configuration\Host\IHostSettingsAppService.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines an interface IHostSettingsAppService with three methods: GetAllSettings, UpdateAllSettings, and SendTestEmail. These methods are part of a service application handling host settings.
## Changes
No changes were made between the modified and unmodified versions; both files contain identical code.
## Purpose
The file is an interface used in an ASP.NET Zero solution for managing configuration settings and sending test emails, likely as part of dependency injection mechanisms.
