# Modified
## Filename
ThemeSettingsDto.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Configuration\Dto\ThemeSettingsDto.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a theme settings DTO class with several properties (Theme, Layout, Header, SubHeader, Menu, Footer) each mapping to corresponding DTOs. The unmodified version is identical except for an explicit constructor call on the Layout property in the modified version.
## Changes
In the modified version, the Layout property explicitly calls its constructor when initializing, whereas this is not shown in the unmodified version.
## Purpose
The file contains DTO classes used for configuration settings within an ASP.NET Zero application.
