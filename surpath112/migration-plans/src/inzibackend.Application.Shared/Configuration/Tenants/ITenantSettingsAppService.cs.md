# Modified
## Filename
ITenantSettingsAppService.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Configuration\Tenants\ITenantSettingsAppService.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines an interface ITenantSettingsAppService which inherits from IApplicationService. It includes four methods: GetAllSettings(), UpdateAllSettings(TenantSettingsEditDto input), ClearLogo(), and ClearCustomCss(). The unmodified version is identical except for a namespace declaration.
## Changes
The only change between the modified and unmodified versions is in the using directive within the namespace, where an additional reference to 'using inzibackend.Configuration.Tenants.Dto;' was added.
## Purpose
This file defines service interface methods related to configuration management for a .NET application.
