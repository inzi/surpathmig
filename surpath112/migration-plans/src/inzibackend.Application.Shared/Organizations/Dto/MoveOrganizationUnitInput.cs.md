# Modified
## Filename
MoveOrganizationUnitInput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Organizations\Dto\MoveOrganizationUnitInput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a class MoveOrganizationUnitInput with properties Id and NewParentId. The Id property is configured with a range validation from 1 to long.MaxValue, indicating it's non-nullable. The NewParentId property is nullable (long? type). This appears to be part of an ASP.NET Zero configuration for dependency injection.
## Changes
