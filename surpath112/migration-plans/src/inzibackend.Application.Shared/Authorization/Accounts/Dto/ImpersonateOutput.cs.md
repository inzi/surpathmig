# Modified
## Filename
ImpersonateOutput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Authorization\Accounts\Dto\ImpersonateOutput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file contains an ImpersonateOutput class with two properties (ImpersonationToken and TenancyName) that are formatted with better spacing.
## Changes
The formatting of the code has been improved by reducing indentation from eight spaces to four spaces for each property.
## Purpose
The class serves as a data transfer object (DTO) holding sensitive information such as tokens and tenancy names, crucial for security in an ASP.NET Zero solution.
