# Modified
## Filename
SubscriptionPaymentListDto.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\MultiTenancy\Payments\Dto\SubscriptionPaymentListDto.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a SubscriptionPaymentListDto class that inherits from AuditedEntityDto. The class includes properties such as Gateway, Amount, EditionId, DayCount, PaymentPeriodType, ExternalPaymentId, PayerId, Status, EditionDisplayName, TenantId, and InvoiceNo.
## Changes
The modified version of the file is missing the 'InvoiceNo' property compared to the unmodified version. This suggests that the 'InvoiceNo' field was either removed or not included in the modified configuration.
## Purpose
The class appears to be part of an ASP.NET Zero solution, likely used for defining data transfer objects (DTOs) related to payment lists, facilitating dependency injection and project configuration.
