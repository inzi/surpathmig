# Modified
## Filename
GetTenantFeaturesEditOutput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\MultiTenancy\Dto\GetTenantFeaturesEditOutput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines a class GetTenantFeaturesEditOutput with two properties: FeatureValues and Features. Both properties are lists of DTOs (NameValueDto and FlatFeatureDto) used to represent tenant features.
## Changes
No changes were made between the modified and unmodified versions of the file; they are identical.
## Purpose
The class serves as a data transfer object for storing feature information, likely part of an ASP.NET Zero solution where consistent handling of feature data across services is important.
