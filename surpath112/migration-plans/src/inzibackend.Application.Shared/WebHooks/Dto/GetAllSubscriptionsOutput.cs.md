# Modified
## Filename
GetAllSubscriptionsOutput.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\WebHooks\Dto\GetAllSubscriptionsOutput.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file defines an EntityDto class GetAllSubscriptionsOutput with properties WebhookUri (string), IsActive (bool), and Webhooks (List<string>). It appears to be part of an ASP.NET WebHooks application handling subscription webhook configurations.
## Changes
The only change is the indentation of the namespace declaration in the modified version, which does not affect functionality.
## Purpose
The class serves as a data transfer object for defining subscription webhook endpoints and their associated information within an ASP.NET Zero-based project.
