# Modified
## Filename
INotificationAppService.cs
## Relative Path
inzibackend.Application.Shared\Notifications\INotificationAppService.cs
## Language
C#
## Summary
The modified file introduces an interface INotificationAppService that includes methods for handling notifications such as setting notifications as read, getting notification settings, updating settings, deleting notifications, and deleting all user notifications. It also appears to have removed some additional methods present in the unmodified version.
## Changes
The modified file has removed the following lines compared to the unmodified version: CreateMassNotification(CreateMassNotificationInput input), CreateNewVersionReleasedNotification(), ShouldUserUpdateApp(), GetAllNotifiers(), and GetNotificationsPublishedByUser(input). Additionally, it now includes fewer notification-related methods.
## Purpose
The interface is part of an ASP.NET Zero solution likely focused on managing user notifications within the application.
