If this is an asp.net zero project, you can use ragdocs to find documentation for this version of asp.net zero. If you don't know how, ask ragdocs for how to identify the asp.net zero version. There are documents in ragdocs specific to asp.net zero, and you can specify the version in the metadata search_files for asp.net related documentation.


When asked to generate documentation how to implement something you've just done, or if the implementation was particular complex, always use the ragdocs mcp server to generate a markdown document via the document_implementation_steps tool. Remember to show your generated steps to the user, first, before calling add_content_documentation.
