# Determining root cause of issues

## Approaching issues strategy
- Identify the Top 3 Suspects that are likely culprits causing this issue.
- For each suspect, create brief justification and approximate confidence score (e.g., 70%, 50%, 30%).
- Determine the immediate steps needed to further investigate or isolate each suspect.
- Before writing any code, present a high-level but thorough solution strategy for the most likely culprit, explaining the design considerations and any potential architectural impacts of the fix for the user to approve or refine.
