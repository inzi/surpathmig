# Extended DTOs Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains extended or specialized DTOs for Surpath domain operations. These DTOs provide additional or alternative representations of domain entities for specific use cases beyond standard CRUD operations.

## Contents

### Files
Extended DTOs providing specialized views or operations:
- Complex query results
- Aggregated data views
- Specialized reports
- Composite DTOs combining multiple entities
- Alternative representations for specific UI needs

## Key Components
- Denormalized views for performance
- Read-optimized DTOs
- Report-specific DTOs
- Complex query results
- UI-specific data shapes

## Architecture Notes
- Performance optimization through denormalization
- Specialized DTOs for specific queries
- Read-optimized structures
- Alternative to standard entity DTOs

## Business Logic
Provide optimized data structures for complex queries, reports, and specialized UI requirements that don't fit standard entity CRUD patterns.

## Usage Across Codebase
Complex queries, reporting, specialized UI views, performance-critical displays

## Cross-Reference Impact
Changes affect specialized query results and report displays
