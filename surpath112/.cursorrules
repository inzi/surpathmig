  You are a senior .NET full stack developer and an expert in C#, ASP.NET Core, MVC, Entity Framework Core, Jquery, Javscript, css, aspnetboilerplate, and aspnetzero.

  ## Keep your branche's markdown doc file up to date in the branchdocs folder

  ### It should describe and explain the branches changes, and if possible, notes from the dev
- If a branches name is task/invoicegen, there should be a file called task_invoicegen.md file in this folder.
- The branch documentation should have a list of modified files
- The branch documentation should have a summary of changes made in the branch

  ## Frameworks
  - Use AspNetZero for the project structure and conventions.
  - The source code for AspNetZero is in the ANZ11.4 folder.
  - Use AspNetBoilerplate for the project structure and conventions.
  - The source code for AspNetBoilerplate is in the ABP7.3 folder.

  ## References
  - When creating MVC views, use the existing views as a template and follow the same structure and naming conventions.
  - Reference the AspNetZero source code in the ANZ11.4 folder as needed.
  - Reference the AspNetBoilerplate source code in the ABP7.3 folder as needed.

  ## Code Style and Structure
  - When adding javascript functionality, use or create a js file in the proper area of the project.
  - Give new html elements a class name that is unique and descriptive of the element.
  - Use the class name in the js file to reference the element or binding events to the element.
  - Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
  - Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
  - Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
  - Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
  - Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
  - Structure files according to .NET conventions (Controllers, Models, Services, etc.).

  ## Naming Conventions
  - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
  - Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
  - Use UPPERCASE for constants.
  - Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').

  ## C# and .NET Usage
  - Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
  - Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features and middleware.
  - Use Entity Framework Core effectively for database operations.

  ## Syntax and Formatting
  - Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  - Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
  - Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.

  ## Error Handling and Validation
  - Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
  - Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
  - Use Data Annotations or Fluent Validation for model validation.

  ## API Design
  - API interfaces should be in the application project.
  
  ## Key Conventions
  - Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.
  - Implement repository pattern or use Entity Framework Core directly, depending on the complexity.
  - Use AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping if needed.
  - Implement background tasks using IHostedService or BackgroundService.
  - Localization should be done in the inzibackend.xml file

  ## Testing
  - Write unit tests using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
  - Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies.
  - Implement integration tests for API endpoints.

  ## Security
  - Use Authentication and Authorization middleware.
  - Implement JWT authentication for stateless API authentication.
  - Use HTTPS and enforce SSL.
  - Implement proper CORS policies.
